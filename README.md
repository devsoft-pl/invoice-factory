<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
<u>About The Project</u>
<p>This project is a user-friendly invoicing application designed to streamline your business processes. 
With its intuitive interface and robust features, managing your invoices has never been easier. 
Here's what you can do with the application:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Add Your Company:</b> Easily add your company details to the system. 
        You can manage multiple companies under one account, making it convenient for businesses with diverse operations.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Manage Contacts:</b> Add an unlimited number of contacts, including both business entities (client) and individuals (person). 
        Keep track of your clients and partners effortlessly.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Create and Edit Invoices:</b> Generate sales or purchase invoices with ease. 
        Enjoy the flexibility of editing or deleting invoices as needed. 
        The application allows you to generate invoices in PDF format for seamless sharing and record-keeping.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Recurring Invoices:</b> Set up recurring invoices for your clients to automate your billing process. 
        Forget about monthly invoice creation; the application will handle it for you. 
        Receive email notifications along with the invoice attachment when a recurring invoice is generated.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Automatic Currency Conversion:</b> When invoicing in foreign currencies, let the application take care of currency conversion for you.
        It automatically fetches exchange rates from the National Bank of Poland (NBP) for accurate and up-to-date currency conversion.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Month-end Closing:</b> Set a specific day for month-end closing and effortlessly reconcile your invoices. 
        The application gathers all invoices for the previous month and sends them collectively to the designated recipient, whether it's yourself or your accountant. 
        Once the month is closed, invoices cannot be edited, ensuring data integrity.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Create a correction for the invoice:</b> If you notice an error on the issued invoice, you have the option to create a correction regardless of whether you have closed the month or not. 
        The correction allows you to rectify errors on the invoice and include them in the accounting records.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Revenue Reporting:</b> The application generates revenue reports for issued sales invoices for each year. 
        Additionally, it creates revenue charts based on these invoices, providing users with quick access to company revenues.
    </li>
</ul>
